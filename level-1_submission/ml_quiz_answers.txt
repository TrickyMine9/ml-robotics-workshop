Q1) Define supervised learning from learners perspective? Provide an example.
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from input-output pairs, and uses these data only to train. It is a method where the algorithm learns to map input data on its own and find optimal output depending upon given labels.
Example: Prediction of house prices considering features like size, location and number_of_rooms In other words.
Q2) What is the difference between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning?
Supervised Learning
	Unsupervised Learning
	Clearly labeled data (input-output pairs).
	Uses unlabeled data without predefined labels.
	The model learns to predict outputs from inputs based on these labels.
	Identifies patterns, clusters, or structures in data.
	Used for tasks like classification and regression
	Used for tasks like clustering and anomaly detection.
	Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall 
	Difficult to evaluate; uses methods like clustering accuracy.
	Q3) How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?
Reinforcement learning is similar to but at the same time differing from supervised and reraltaedproblemresentations in regards of how it interacts with data:
Reinforcement Learning:
* An environment where the model can learn. For instance, it either reaps rewards or faces repercussions based on the actions.
* It goes around the environment seeking to cause as much reward money to accumulate over time.
* A robot that learns to walk with trial and error.
Supervised Learning:
* It works by learning from a training set of labeled examples. ​It does not wander or participate in exploring an environment.
* Example:- Predicting stocks based on previous historical data
