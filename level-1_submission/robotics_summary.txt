Q1) What Are The Essentials Of A Robot?
Three basic components of robot are:
Mechanical Structure: What human anatomy inspires. Have you ever taken a close up look at the simple components of robot structure? These locomotion mechanisms like wheels or legs along with hybrid systems achieve greater mobility and versatility in kinematic behaviors across various terrains.
Actuators: Generate movement and are used to power joints, enabling robots to perform important functions like manipulation (i.e. picking up a pencil), locomotion or walking around the lab) as well precise positioning of tools on machines in factories or medical devices delivered surgically by robots inside someone's body.
Sensors: Others include sensors which specifically monitor the robot's state (such as joint encoders, etc.), and other external sensor sets such as cameras or range finders that acquire information about a substantial portion of the surrounding environment. These are essential for navigation, performing tasks and adjusting to the environment.
Control Systems: Algorithms within the cloud that process sensor data, act on this information to control actuators and other devices as well instruct robots how they must navigate for manipulation of objects or interaction with nearby IoT gadgets.
Computational Systems: The system processes information, stores commands and carries out tasks that require decisions to be made in real-time allowing autonomous operations.


Q2) List three applications of robotics in the real world.
* Manufacturing: Robots assemble parts, perform welding, and handle materials with high precision in automated factories.
* Exploration: Robots, like Mars rovers, collect data and navigate challenging terrains in space and deep-sea environments.
* Healthcare: Robots assist in minimally invasive surgeries, rehabilitation, and medical tasks requiring precision and dexterity.
